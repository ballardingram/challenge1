# Horiseon

## Purpose
This website was built to showcase refactoring skills. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 1 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
This website was built with HTML and CSS. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. I used Chrome's Dev Tools to make small changes that I could preview prior to making changes to the actual code.

## Website
You can find the final product at:
https://github.com/ballardingram/challenge1.git

## Contributions
This was largely and independent project. I worked with Ask BCS and my TA Ian Sears to commit changes to my GitHub repository.
