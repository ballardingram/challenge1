# Horiseon

## Purpose
This website was built to showcase refactoring skills. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 1 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
This website was built with HTML and CSS. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. I used Chrome's Dev Tools to make small changes that I could preview prior to making changes to the actual code.

## Website
You can find the final product at:
https://github.com/ballardingram/challenge1.git

## Contributions
This was largely and independent project. I worked with Ask BCS and my TA Ian Sears to commit changes to my GitHub repository.

## Observations
During the refactoring process I observed several immediate "call to action" items. These included:
- Duplication in the code. This involved consolidating the code that was there for accessibility and ease of maintenance by future users.
- Renaming classes to avoided unnecessary redundacies.
- Restructure elements and the associated IDs for accessibility and ease of maintenance by future users.

## Challenges
In my refactoring process I was met with several challe3nges that required additional research, education, and a "trial and error" process to make the website function as requested from the user story. These included:
- Padding around the box elements.
- Margins around the box, text, and image elements.
- Testing style and elements that were not obvious in the mock-up. An example of this is the header. It is fixed in the final product for a better user experience in navigation, but in the mock-up, this was not requested.
